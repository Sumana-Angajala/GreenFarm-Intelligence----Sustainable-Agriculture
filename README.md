# GreenFarm-Intelligence----Sustainable-Agriculture



## ðŸ“Œ Week 1 â€“ Data Preprocessing & Visualization (EDA)

In Week 1 of **GreenFarm-Intelligence**, the focus was on **understanding and exploring the dataset**.
The tasks included:

* ðŸ“‚ Uploading the **Crop Recommendation dataset**
* ðŸ§¹ Performing **data cleaning & preprocessing** (checking missing values, data types, etc.)
* ðŸ“Š Conducting **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to extract insights from the dataset
* ðŸ“ˆ Creating visualizations to understand patterns and correlations, including:

  * Distribution plots for **N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall**
  * Correlation heatmap between features
  * Crop distribution chart (label frequency)

### âœ… Week 1 Deliverables

* `Week1_EDA_GreenFarmIntelligence.ipynb` â†’ Jupyter Notebook with all preprocessing & visualizations
* `Crop_recommendation.csv` â†’ Dataset used for analysis
* ðŸ“Š Generated plots showing data insights

âš¡ This sets a strong foundation for Week 2, where model building (crop recommendation, yield prediction, disease detection) will be implemented.
